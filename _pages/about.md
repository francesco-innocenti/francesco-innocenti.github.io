Hi! I‚Äôm Francesco.

I‚Äôm currently a PhD student in Machine Learning and Theoretical Neuroscience 
at the University of Sussex, supervised by [Christopher Buckley](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nWuZ0XcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) 
and [Anil Seth](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3eJCZCkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). 
My research has so far focused on brain-inspired learning algorithms for 
training neural networks as an alternative to standard backpropagation. More 
broadly, I am interested in energy-based models, the optimisation dynamics of 
neural networks, and all things AI-related.

Previously, I interned as an Applied Scientist at Amazon, helping to improve their 
model forecasts to deliver packages throughout Europe more efficiently. During 
my undergrad, I was also a research assistant in the lab of [Devin Terhune](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rBgJFwYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), 
using machine learning tools to differentiate the subjective experiences 
associated with different psychedelic drugs.

Outside of work, I enjoy swimming, running, and playing football, and am always 
up for a physical challenge!

## üá∫üá∏ Papers accepted at NeurIPS 2025 (San Diego)
*September 2025*

I will be at NeurIPS this year in San Diego to present two papers: 
[ŒºPC: Scaling Predictive Coding to 100+ Layer Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13124) 
(main track) and A Simple Generalisation of the Implicit Dynamics of In-Context 
Learning (workshop). The first introduces a reparameterisation of predictive 
coding that allows stable training of 100+  layer residual networks on simple 
tasks with zero-shot hyperparameter transfer, while the second provides a simple 
theoretical extension of a recent in-context learning result for transformers.


## üö® Paper republished in Journal of Statistical Mechanics 
*July 2025*

A slightly updated version of our NeuIPS 2024 paper on the geometry of the 
energy landscape of predictive coding networks has just been republished [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-5468/ade2eb) 
in the ***Journal of Statistical Mechanics: 
Theory and Experiment*** as part of a Special Issue on ***Machine Learning 2025***.

Our paper [Only Strict Saddles in the Energy Landscape of Predictive Coding Networks?
](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/hash/6075fc6540b9a3cb951752099efd86ef-Abstract-Conference.html) has been 
accepted at NeurIPS 2024! See [this blog post](https://francesco-innocenti.github.io/posts/2024/10/01/The-Energy-Landscape-of-Predictive-Coding-Networks/) 
for the key takeaways.

I recently completed an internship as Applied Scientist at Amazon, in Barcelona. 
I wrote about my experience [here](https://francesco-innocenti.github.io/posts/2024/04/27/Amazon-Internship/) 
if you're interested.

I will be at ICML 2023 in Hawaii to present my work on [Understanding Predictive Coding as a Second-Order Trust-Region Method](https://openreview.net/forum?id=x7PUpFKZ8M), 
which won a Best Paper Award at the [Workshop on Localized Learning](https://sites.google.com/view/localized-learning-workshop).
You can rewatch my talk [here](https://icml.cc/virtual/2023/workshop/21484) or read [my blog post](https://francesco-innocenti.github.io/posts/2023/08/10/PC-as-a-2nd-Order-Method/)
for the key ideas.
