Hi! I’m Francesco.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Oxford in the 
group of [Rafal Bogacz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m02-44gAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). 
Previously, I did my PhD in Machine Learning and Theoretical Neuroscience at the 
University of Sussex, supervised by [Christopher Buckley](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nWuZ0XcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) 
and [Anil Seth](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3eJCZCkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). 
I also interned as an Applied Scientist at Amazon, helping to improve their 
model forecasts to deliver packages throughout Europe more efficiently.

My research has mostly focused on brain-inspired learning algorithms for 
training neural networks as an alternative to standard backpropagation. More 
broadly, I am interested in energy-based models, the optimisation dynamics of 
neural networks, and all things AI-related.

Outside of work, I enjoy swimming and calisthenics, and am always up for a 
physical challenge!

## 🇬🇧 Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Oxford
*October 2025*

I am excited to share that in November I will be starting as a Postdoctoral 
Researcher in the group of Professor [Rafal Bogacz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m02-44gAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).


## 🇲🇦 Visiting Researcher at UM6P, Morocco
*October 2025*

I am pleased to share that, from October 21st to November 1st, I will be 
visiting my amazing collaborator, [El Mehdi Achour](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=A-i6nwgAAAAJ&hl=en), 
at UM6P in Morocco, to work on LLM mixture of experts.


## 🇺🇸 Papers accepted at NeurIPS 2025 (San Diego)
*September 2025*

</p>

I will be at NeurIPS this year in San Diego to present two papers: 
[μPC: Scaling Predictive Coding to 100+ Layer Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13124) 
(main track) and A Simple Generalisation of the Implicit Dynamics of In-Context 
Learning (workshop). The first introduces a reparameterisation of predictive 
coding that allows stable training of 100+  layer residual networks on simple 
tasks with zero-shot hyperparameter transfer, while the second provides a simple 
theoretical extension of a recent in-context learning result for transformers.


## 🚨 Paper republished in Journal of Statistical Mechanics 
*July 2025*

A slightly updated version of our NeuIPS 2024 paper on the geometry of the 
energy landscape of predictive coding networks has just been republished [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-5468/ade2eb) 
in the ***Journal of Statistical Mechanics: 
Theory and Experiment*** as part of a Special Issue on ***Machine Learning 2025***.


## 💻‍ Introducing JPC

</p>

⭐️ Our lab just released [JPC
](https://github.com/thebuckleylab/jpc), a **J**AX library for training neural 
networks with **P**redictive **C**oding. See this [pre-print
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03676) for more details.
