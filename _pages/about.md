Hi! I’m Francesco.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Oxford in 
the group of [Rafal Bogacz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m02-44gAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). 
Previously, I did my PhD in Machine Learning and Theoretical Neuroscience at the 
University of Sussex, supervised by [Christopher Buckley](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nWuZ0XcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) 
and [Anil Seth](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3eJCZCkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). 
I also interned as an Applied Scientist at Amazon, helping to improve their 
model forecasts to deliver packages throughout Europe more efficiently.

My research focuses on understanding the training dynamics and scaling 
behaviour of artificial and biological neural networks. I like to understand 
things through the lens of optimisation theory, and am broadly interested in 
energy-based models, time-series forecasting, and all things AI-related.

Outside of work, I enjoy swimming and calisthenics, and am always up for a 
physical challenge!
