Hi! I‚Äôm Francesco.

I‚Äôm currently a PhD student in Theoretical Neuroscience and Machine Learning at the University of Sussex, supervised 
by [Christopher Buckley](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nWuZ0XcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Anil Seth
](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3eJCZCkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). My PhD is about scaling a brain-inspired local learning algorithm called "predictive coding", as a potentially more efficient alternative to standard backpropagation. I use both theory and experiment, with a focus on optimisation theory.

I recently interned as an Applied Scientist at Amazon, helping to improve their model forecasts to deliver packages 
throughout Europe more efficiently. During my undergrad, I worked as a research assistant in [Ashok Jansari](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=vwtx4TsAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)‚Äôs 
lab at Goldsmiths, University of London, helping to develop a face memory test aimed at people with both poor and 
exceptional face recognition abilities. I also interned in the lab of [Devin Terhune](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rBgJFwYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), 
using machine learning tools to differentiate the subjective experiences associated with different psychedelic drugs.

Outside of work, I enjoy running, swimming and playing football, and am always up for a physical challenge!

We introduce [ŒºPC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13124), a reparameterisation of 
predictive coding that allows stable training of 100+ layer residual networks 
with zero-shot hyperparameter transfer. See [this post](https://francesco-innocenti.github.io/posts/2025/05/20/Scaling-Predictive-Coding-to-100+-Layer-Networks/) 
for a summary. Code [here](https://github.com/thebuckleylab/jpc/tree/main/experiments/mupc_paper).

I will be at ICML 2023 in Hawaii to present my work on [Understanding Predictive Coding as a Second-Order Trust-Region Method](https://openreview.net/forum?id=x7PUpFKZ8M), 
which won a Best Paper Award at the [Workshop on Localized Learning](https://sites.google.com/view/localized-learning-workshop).
You can rewatch my talk [here](https://icml.cc/virtual/2023/workshop/21484) or read [my blog post](https://francesco-innocenti.github.io/posts/2023/08/10/PC-as-a-2nd-Order-Method/)
