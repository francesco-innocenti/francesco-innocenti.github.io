Hi! I’m Francesco.

I’m currently a PhD student in Machine Learning and Theoretical Neuroscience at the University of Sussex, supervised 
by [Christopher Buckley](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nWuZ0XcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Anil Seth
](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3eJCZCkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). 
My research interests include biologically plausible learning (how to make artificial neural networks learn more like 
brains) and deep learning theory (understanding how modern deep networks work in the first place).

I recently interned as an Applied Scientist at Amazon, helping to improve their model forecasts to deliver packages 
throughout Europe more efficiently. During my undergrad, I worked as a research assistant in [Ashok Jansari](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=vwtx4TsAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)’s 
lab at Goldsmiths, University of London, helping to develop a face memory test aimed at people with both poor and 
exceptional face recognition abilities. I also interned in the lab of [Devin Terhune](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rBgJFwYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), 
using machine learning tools to differentiate the subjective experiences associated with different psychedelic drugs.

Outside of work, I enjoy running, swimming and playing football, and am always up for a physical challenge!
