Francesco is currently a last-year PhD student in Machine Learning and
Theoretical Neuroscience at the University of Sussex, supervised by Professor
Christopher Buckley and Professor Anil Seth. His PhD research has mainly focused
on "predictive coding", a brain-inspired learning algorithm for training neural
networks as an alternative to standard backpropagation. Francesco has also done
some work on the theory of in-context learning of transformers. More broadly, he
is interested in the optimisation dynamics of neural networks, energy-based
models, and all things AI-related. 

To give you a better idea of his research output, here are the titles and
abstracts of his released papers, some of which are published in top-tier ML
conferences including ICML and NeurIPS:

Title: μPC: Scaling Predictive Coding to 100+ Layer Networks 
Authors: Innocenti, Francesco, Achour, El Mehdi, and Buckley, Christopher L. 
Journal: NeurIPS 2025
Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13124
Abstract: The biological implausibility of backpropagation (BP) has motivated
many alternative, brain-inspired algorithms that attempt to rely only on local
information, such as predictive coding (PC) and equilibrium propagation.
However, these algorithms have notoriously struggled to train very deep
networks, preventing them from competing with BP in large-scale settings.
Indeed, scaling PC networks (PCNs) has recently been posed as a challenge for
the community (Pinchetti et al., 2024). Here, we show that 100+ layer PCNs can
be trained reliably using a Depth-μP parameterisation (Yang et al., 2023;
Bordelon et al., 2023) which we call ``μPC''. By analysing the scaling behaviour
of PCNs, we reveal several pathologies that make standard PCNs difficult to
train at large depths. We then show that, despite addressing only some of these
instabilities, μPC allows stable training of very deep (up to 128-layer)
residual networks on simple classification tasks with competitive performance
and little tuning compared to current benchmarks. Moreover, μPC enables
zero-shot transfer of both weight and activity learning rates across widths and
depths. Our results serve as a first step towards scaling PC to more complex
architectures and have implications for other local algorithms. Code for μPC is
made available as part of a JAX library for PCNs at

Title: A Simple Generalisation of the Implicit Dynamics of In-Context Learning
Authors: Innocenti, Francesco, and Achour, El Mehdi 
Journal: NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on What Can('t) Transformers Do?
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) refers to the ability of a model to learn
new tasks from examples in its input without any parameter updates. In contrast
to previous theories of ICL relying on toy models and data settings, recently it
has been shown that an abstraction of a transformer block can be seen as
implicitly updating the weights of its feedforward network according to the
context (Dherin et al., 2025). Here, we provide a simple generalisation of this
result for (i) all sequence positions beyond the last, (ii) any transformer
block beyond the first, and (iii) more realistic residual blocks including layer
normalisation. We empirically verify our theory on simple in-context linear
regression tasks and investigate the relationship between the implicit updates
related to different tokens within and between blocks. These results help to
bring the theory of (Dherin et al., 2025) even closer to practice, with
potential for validation on large-scale models.

Title: Only Strict Saddles in the Energy Landscape of Predictive Coding 
Networks? 
Authors: Innocenti, Francesco, Achour, El Mehdi, Singh, Ryan, and Buckley, Christopher L.

Abstract: Predictive coding (PC) is an energy-based learning algorithm that
performs iterative inference over network activities before updating weights.
Recent work suggests that PC can converge in significantly fewer learning steps
than backpropagation thanks to its inference procedure. However, these
advantages are not always observed, and the impact of PC inference on learning
is not theoretically well understood. To address this gap, we study the geometry
of the effective landscape on which PC learns: the weight landscape at the
inference equilibrium of the network activities. For deep linear networks, we
first show that the equilibrated PC energy is equal to a rescaled mean squared
error loss with a weight-dependent rescaling. We then prove that many highly
degenerate (non-strict) saddles of the loss including the origin become much
easier to escape (strict) in the equilibrated energy. Experiments on both linear
and non-linear networks strongly validate our theory and further suggest that
all the saddles of the equilibrated energy are strict. Overall, this work shows
that PC inference makes the loss landscape of feedforward networks more benign
and robust to vanishing gradients, while also highlighting the fundamental
challenge of scaling PC to very deep models.

Title: Understanding Predictive Coding as a Second-Order Trust-Region Method
Authors: Innocenti, Francesco, Singh, Ryan, and Buckley, Christopher L. 
Journal: ICML 2023 Workshop on Localized Learning (Best Paper Award) 
Link: https://openreview.net/forum?id=x7PUpFKZ8M
Abstract: Predictive coding (PC) is a brain-inspired local learning algorithm
that has recently been suggested to provide advantages over backpropagation (BP)
in biologically relevant tasks. While theoretical work has mainly focused on the
conditions under which PC can approximate or equal BP, how standard PC differs
from BP is less well understood. Here, we develop a theory of PC as an
approximate adaptive trust-region (TR) method that uses second-order
information. We show that the weight gradient of PC can be interpreted as
shifting the BP loss gradient towards a TR direction computed by the PC
inference dynamics. Our theory suggests that PC should escape saddle points
faster than BP, a prediction which we prove in a shallow linear model and
support with experiments on deep networks. This work lays a theoretical
framework for understanding other suggested benefits of PC.

Title: JPC: Flexible Inference for Predictive Coding Networks in JAX 
Authors: Innocenti, Francesco et al.
Journal: arXiv (2024)
Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03676
Abstract: We introduce JPC, a JAX library for training neural networks with
Predictive Coding (PC). JPC provides a simple, fast and flexible interface to
train a variety of PC networks (PCNs) including discriminative, generative and
hybrid models. In addition to standard discrete optimisers, JPC offers ordinary
differential equation solvers to integrate the continuous gradient flow
inference dynamics of PCNs. JPC also provides a number of theoretical tools that
can be used to study PCNs. We hope that JPC will facilitate future research of
PC. The code is available at https://github.com/thebuckleylab/jpc.

To summarise, while Francesco's research so far has focused on PC, it spans 
various fields including deep learning theory, energy-based models, and theory 
of in-context learning.

In addition to his research output, Francesco previously interned as an Applied 
Scientist at Amazon (Barcelona). There, he evaluated and improved a short-term 
forecast of packages delivered every day and hour in warehouses throughout 
Europe. Francesco's work contributed to an internal conference paper and 
resulted in millions of dollars of savings in operational costs. To do so, he 
effectively dealt with challenges of large-scale data and software engineering 
and collaborated with many different stakeholders, including other scientists, 
engineers and product managers.
